<p>
    <strong>Driver App</strong> is a comprehensive logistics application designed for drivers to simplify transport order processing.
    With features like client ID login, real-time order information, task timelines, and document sharing, it significantly improves operational efficiency.
</p>
<p>
    Drivers can monitor their activities, send delay notifications, access navigation tools (Google, Sygic, TomTom, Waze), and manage dangerous goods with ease.
    The app also supports capturing, editing, and exchanging documents, and it logs all actions and sync status with the server.
</p>
<p>
    Server communication is handled reliably using sockets, while notifications are pushed via Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM).
    The app tracks driver behavior, sends analytics to Firebase, and reports logical errors and crash logs to Crashlytics â€” maintaining a crash rate of less than 0.2%.
</p>
